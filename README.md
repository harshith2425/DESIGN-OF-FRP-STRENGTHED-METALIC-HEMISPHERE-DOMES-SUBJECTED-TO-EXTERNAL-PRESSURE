# DESIGN-OF-FRP-STRENGTHED-METALIC-HEMISPHERE-DOMES-SUBJECTED-TO-EXTERNAL-PRESSURE
Thin metallic cylindrical shell structures wrapped externally with one or multiple layers of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composite sheets exhibit a significant increase in buckling capacity and ductility. The existing research is minimal, limited to shells of specific radius-to-thickness ratios, and often reported only the buckling capacity and ductility percentage increase. This research is intended to bridge this gap and provide a comprehensive understanding of the buckling behavior of metalFRP hybrid shell structures. It focusses on 1) detailed numerical modeling addressing different aspects as well as non-linarites viz. intra-laminar and interfacial damage specific to metal-FRP hybrid shells, 2) effectiveness of FRP strengthening and effective FRP strengthening methods for metallic shells of all possible ratios, 3) imperfection sensitivity of hybrid shells of different rratios, 4) the effect of cut-outs in thin airframe hybrid shells of higher ratios, and 5) experimental validation of buckling characteristics of both the metallic and metal-FRP hybrid airframe plain cylindrical shells. Thus, the thesis brings out the following aspects of metal-FRP hybrid shells: 1) the effect of interfacial and intraluminal FRP damage on buckling behavior, 2) the effectiveness of FRP strengthening on the general buckling behavior of shells of different ratios, 3) the sensitivity to imperfections, 4) the effect of unstiffened and stiffened cut-outs on elastically buckling shells, and 5) the methods to assess bond quality, measurement of imperfections and experimental validation.

Key Words: Metal-FRP, Buckling Characteristics, Bond Quality, Buckling Behaviour.
